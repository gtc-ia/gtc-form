## 💻 Terminal Access (Windows / Linux) and Code Editors

### 🔦 Local Terminal (Windows / Linux)

**Purpose:** Manage applications and services on the `GTC1` server via SSH.

* **Primary SSH access:**

  ```bash
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/GTC1_key.pem kfilipenko@agent.gtstor.com
  ```
* Supported environments:

  * Windows Terminal / PowerShell / WSL
  * Linux Shell (bash, zsh)
* The private key is stored at `C:\ssh\GTC1_key.pem` on Windows and must be copied to `~/.ssh` when using WSL
* Passwordless login using SSH key authentication

---

### 🧪 Code Editors and Development Interfaces

#### ✅ Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

* **Main local editor**
* Supports **Remote SSH** connection to `GTC1`
* Full access to project directories:

  * `~/n8n`
  * `~/OpenDevin`
  * and others
* Easy editing of config files: `docker-compose.yml`, `.env`, `n8n_update.sh`, etc.

#### ✅ VS Code Server (code-server)

* Installed on `GTC1`
* Accessible via browser (internal/private only)
* Direct access to system files and logs through browser-based editor
* Useful for offline/private development

#### ✅ GitHub Codespaces (cloud development)

* Used for developing repositories like `gtc-form`, `gtc-workflows`
* Fully integrated with GitHub
* AI-assisted code suggestions and auto-save support

### ♻️ Workflow Summary

1. Connect to `GTC1` using terminal (Windows/Linux/WSL)
2. Open project in VS Code (locally or via server)
3. Edit code and configs
4. Manage services (e.g., restart `n8n`, backup PostgreSQL, update scripts)
5. Version control via Git / GitHub

### ⚙️ Optional: VS Code Remote SSH Setup (Windows)

1. Install [Remote - SSH extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh)
2. Add this to `~/.ssh/config` (WSL or Git Bash):

   ```ssh
   Host gtc1
       HostName agent.gtstor.com
       User kfilipenko
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/GTC1_key.pem
   ```
3. Run from VS Code Command Palette:

   > `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host...` -> `gtc1`

This structure provides a unified terminal and code management environment across local and cloud systems for seamless development and server control.
